# ColorJam

- Extracts dominant colors from album art and synchronizes them with the music, using Python to handle song data retrieval and color processing.
- ATmega328P microcontroller is used to drive the LEDs. LEDs change colors in real-time, reacting to the rhythm and mood of each track.
- LEDs react to the audio, changing colors and patterns in real-time based on sound intensity and rhythm, using a sound sensor to detect audio signals and trigger LED color changes to trigger visual effects.
